# How to contribute

## Files & Variables
 - File names use `kebab-case`
 - Variables use `snake_Camel_Case`
 - Constants use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

## Commits
Commit titles should consisted of only 3-4 words, and be prefaced with a one of 4 verbs; `Create`, `Amend`, `Update`, or `Delete`.  
For example, `Amend README.md` would suggest that errors were fixed (such as incorrect info, typos, moving location, etc). Alternatively, `Update README.md` would suggest that new information was added.
